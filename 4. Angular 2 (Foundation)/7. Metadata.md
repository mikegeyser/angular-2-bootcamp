Metadata tells Angular how to process a class.
Looking back at the code for `HeroListComponent`, you can see that it's just a class.
There is no evidence of a framework, no "Angular" in it at all.

In fact, `HeroListComponent` really is *just a class*. It's not a component until you *tell Angular about it*.

To tell Angular that `HeroListComponent` is a component, attach **metadata** to the class.

In TypeScript, you attach metadata by using a **decorator**.
Here's some metadata for `HeroListComponent`:

```TypeScript
  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector:    'hero-list',
    templateUrl: 'hero-list.component.html',
    providers:  [ HeroService ]
  })
  export class HeroListComponent implements OnInit {
  /* . . . */
  }
```

Here is the `@Component` decorator, which identifies the class
immediately below it as a component class.

The `@Component` decorator takes a required configuration object with the
information Angular needs to create and present the component and its view.

Here are a few of the possible `@Component` configuration options:

- `moduleId`: sets the source of the base address (`module.id`) for module-relative URLs such as the `templateUrl`.

- `selector`: CSS selector that tells Angular to create and insert an instance of this component
where it finds a `<hero-list>` tag in *parent* HTML.
For example, if an app's  HTML contains `<hero-list></hero-list>`, then
Angular inserts an instance of the `HeroListComponent` view between those tags.

- `templateUrl`: module-relative address of this component's HTML template, shown in the template section.

- `providers`: array of **dependency injection providers** for services that the component requires.
This is one way to tell Angular that the component's constructor requires a `HeroService`
so it can get the list of heroes to display.

The metadata in the `@Component` tells Angular where to get the major building blocks you specify for the component.

The template, metadata, and component together describe a view.

Apply other metadata !{_decorator}s in a similar fashion to guide Angular behavior.
`@Injectable`, `@Input`, and `@Output` are a few of the more popular decorators.

The architectural takeaway is that you must add metadata to your code
so that Angular knows what to do.

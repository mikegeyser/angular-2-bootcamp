Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and
either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript.

The framework consists of several libraries, some of them core and some optional.

You write Angular applications by composing HTML *templates* with Angularized markup,
writing *component* classes to manage those templates, adding application logic in *services*,
and boxing components and services in *modules*.

Then you launch the app by *bootstrapping* the _root module_.
Angular takes over, presenting your application content in a browser and
responding to user interactions according to the instructions you've provided.

Of course, there is more to it than this.
You'll learn the details in the pages that follow. For now, focus on the big picture.

The architecture diagram identifies the eight main building blocks of an Angular application:

* Modules
* Components
* Templates
* Metadata
* Data binding](#da
* Directives
* Services
* Dependency injection

Learn these building blocks, and you're on your way.

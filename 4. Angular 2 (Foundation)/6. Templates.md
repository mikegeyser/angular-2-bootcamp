You define a component's view with its companion **template**. A template is a form of HTML
that tells Angular how to render the component.

A template looks like regular HTML, except for a few differences. Here is a
template for our `HeroListComponent`:

```html
  <h2>Hero List</h2>
  <p><i>Pick a hero from the list</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="selectHero(hero)">
      {{hero.name}}
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hero-detail *ngIf="selectedHero" [hero]="selectedHero"></hero-detail>
```

Although this template uses typical HTML elements like `<h2>` and  `<p>`, it also has some differences. Code like `*ngFor`, `{{hero.name}}`, `(click)`, `[hero]`, and `<hero-detail>` uses Angular's template syntax.

In the last line of the template, the `<hero-detail>` tag is a custom element that represents a new component, `HeroDetailComponent`.

The `HeroDetailComponent` is a *different* component than the `HeroListComponent` you've been reviewing.
The `HeroDetailComponent` (code not shown) presents facts about a particular hero, the
hero that the user selects from the list presented by the `HeroListComponent`.
The `HeroDetailComponent` is a **child** of the `HeroListComponent`.

Notice how `<hero-detail>` rests comfortably among native HTML elements. Custom components mix seamlessly with native HTML in the same layouts.

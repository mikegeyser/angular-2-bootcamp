A _component_ controls a patch of screen called a *view*.

For example, the following views are controlled by components:

* The app root with the navigation links.
* The list of heroes.
* The hero editor.

You define a component's application logic&mdash;what it does to support the view&mdash;inside a class.
The class interacts with the view through an API of properties and methods.

<a id="component-code"></a>
For example, this `HeroListComponent` has a `heroes` property that returns an array of heroes
that it acquires from a service.
`HeroListComponent` also has a `selectHero()` method that sets a `selectedHero` property when the user clicks to choose a hero from that list.

```TypeScript
  export class HeroListComponent implements OnInit {
    heroes: Hero[];
    selectedHero: Hero;

    constructor(private service: HeroService) { }

    ngOnInit() {
      this.heroes = this.service.getHeroes();
    }

    selectHero(hero: Hero) { this.selectedHero = hero; }
  }
```

Angular creates, updates, and destroys components as the user moves through the application.
Your app can take action at each moment in this lifecycle through optional lifecycle hooks, like `ngOnInit()` declared above.

## Installing TypeScript

We're going to be using NPM to get the TypeScript compiler as we set up earlier, so we need to type:

```TypeScript
  npm install -g typescript
```

In your editor, type the following JavaScript code in `greeter.ts`:

```TypeScript
  function greeter(person) {
      return "Hello, " + person;
  }

  var user = "Jane User";

  console.log(greeter(user));
```

We used a .ts extension, but this code is just JavaScript. You could have copy/pasted this straight out of an existing JavaScript app.

At the command line, run the TypeScript compiler:

```shell
  tsc greeter.ts
```

The result will be a file greeter.js which contains the same JavaScript that you fed in.

Weâ€™re up and running using TypeScript in our JavaScript app!

## Configuration

The presence of a `tsconfig.json` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project.
The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.
A project is compiled in one of the following ways:

## Using tsconfig.json

* By invoking tsc with no input files, in which case the compiler searches for the `tsconfig.json` file starting in the current directory and continuing up the parent directory chain.
* By invoking tsc with no input files and a `--project` (or just `-p`) command line option that specifies the path of a directory containing a `tsconfig.json` file, or a path to a valid `.json` file containing the configurations.

When input files are specified on the command line, `tsconfig.json` files are ignored.

## Examples

Example `tsconfig.json` files:

* Using the `"files"` property

  ```json
  {
      "compilerOptions": {
          "module": "commonjs",
          "noImplicitAny": true,
          "removeComments": true,
          "preserveConstEnums": true,
          "sourceMap": true
      },
      "files": [
          "core.ts",
          "sys.ts",
          "types.ts",
          "scanner.ts",
          "parser.ts",
          "utilities.ts",
          "binder.ts",
          "checker.ts",
          "emitter.ts",
          "program.ts",
          "commandLineParser.ts",
          "tsc.ts",
          "diagnosticInformationMap.generated.ts"
      ]
  }
  ```

* Using the `"include"` and `"exclude"` properties

  ```json
  {
      "compilerOptions": {
          "module": "system",
          "noImplicitAny": true,
          "removeComments": true,
          "preserveConstEnums": true,
          "outFile": "../../built/local/tsc.js",
          "sourceMap": true
      },
      "include": [
          "src/**/*"
      ],
      "exclude": [
          "node_modules",
          "**/*.spec.ts"
      ]
  }
  ```

## Details

The `"compilerOptions"` property can be omitted, in which case the compiler's defaults are used. See our full list of supported [Compiler Options](./Compiler Options.md).

The `"files"` property takes a list of relative or absolute file paths.
The `"include"` and `"exclude"` properties take a list of glob-like file patterns.
The supported glob wildcards are:

* `*` matches zero or more characters (excluding directory separators)
* `?` matches any one character (excluding directory separators)
* `**/` recursively matches any subdirectory

If a segment of a glob pattern includes only `*` or `.*`, then only files with supported extensions are included (e.g. `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.d.ts` by default with `.js` and `.jsx` if `allowJs` is set to true).

If the `"files"` and `"include"` are both left unspecified, the compiler defaults to including all TypeScript (`.ts`, `.d.ts` and `.tsx`) files in the containing directory and subdirectories except those excluded using the `"exclude"` property. JS files (`.js` and `.jsx`) are also included if `allowJs` is set to true.
If the `"files"` or `"include"` properties are specified, the compiler will instead include the union of the files included by those two properties.
Files in the directory specified using the `"outDir"` compiler option are always excluded unless explicitly included via the `"files"` property (even when the "`exclude`" property is specified).

Files included using `"include"` can be filtered using the `"exclude"` property.
However, files included explicitly using the `"files"` property are always included regardless of `"exclude"`.
The `"exclude"` property defaults to excluding the `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `jspm_packages` and `<outDir>` directories when not specified.

Any files that are referenced by files included via the `"files"` or `"include"` properties are also included.
Similarly, if a file `B.ts` is referenced by another file `A.ts`, then `B.ts` cannot be excluded unless the referencing file `A.ts` is also specified in the `"exclude"` list.

A `tsconfig.json` file is permitted to be completely empty, which compiles all files included by default (as described above) with the default compiler options.

Compiler options specified on the command line override those specified in the `tsconfig.json` file.

// TODO: Add a simplified tsconfig.
```json
  {
      "compilerOptions": {
          "module": "system",
          "sourceMap": true
      },
      "include": [
          "**/*.ts"
      ]
  }
```

## `@types`, `typeRoots` and `types`

By default all *visible* "`@types`" packages are included in your compilation.
Packages in `node_modules/@types` of any enclosing folder are considered *visible*;
specifically, that means packages within `./node_modules/@types/`,  `../node_modules/@types/`, `../../node_modules/@types/`, and so on.

If `typesRoots` is specified, *only* packages under `typeRoots` will be included.
For example:

```json
{
   "compilerOptions": {
       "typeRoots" : ["./typings"]
   }
}
```

This config file will include *all* packages under `./typings`, and no packages from `./node_modules/@types`.

If `types` is specified, only packages listed will be included.
For instance:

```json
{
   "compilerOptions": {
       "types" : ["node", "lodash", "express"]
   }
}
```

This `tsconfig.json` file will *only* include  `./node_modules/@types/node`, `./node_modules/@types/lodash` and `./node_modules/@types/express`.
Other packages under `node_modules/@types/*` will not be included.

Specify `"types": []` to disable automatic inclusion of `@types` packages.

Keep in mind that automatic inclusion is only important if you're using files with global declarations (as opposed to files declared as modules).
If you use an `import "foo"` statement, for instance, TypeScript may still look through `node_modules` & `node_modules/@types` folders to find the `foo` package.


## `compileOnSave`

Setting a top-level property `compileOnSave` signals to the IDE to generate all files for a given tsconfig.json upon saving.

```json
{
   "compileOnSave": true,
   "compilerOptions": {
       "noImplicitAny" : true
   }
}
```

This feature is currently supported in Visual Studio 2015 with TypeScript 1.8.4 and above, and [atom-typescript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/tsconfig.md#compileonsave) plugin.

## Transpiling TypeScript into JavaScript using VS Code

VS Code integrates with `tsc` through our integrated [task runner](/docs/editor/tasks.md).  We can use this to transpile `.ts` files into `.js` files.  Let's walk through transpiling a simple TypeScript Hello World program.

### Step 1: Create a simple TS file

Open VS Code on an empty folder and create a `HelloWorld.ts` file, place the following code in that file...

``` typescript
class Startup {
    public static main(): number {
        console.log('Hello World');
        return 0;
    }
}

Startup.main();
```

### Step 2: Create tasks.json

The next step is to set up the task configuration.  To do this open the **Command Palette** with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type in **Configure Task Runner**, press `Enter` to select it. This shows a selection box with templates you can choose from:

![Task Runner Selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/typescript_taskSelection.png)

Select TypeScript - tsconfig.json. This will create a `tasks.json` file in the workspace `.vscode` folder.

The content of the tasks.json file looks like this:

```json
{
	// See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
	// for the documentation about the tasks.json format
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"command": "tsc",
	"isShellCommand": true,
	"args": ["-p", "."],
	"showOutput": "silent",
	"problemMatcher": "$tsc"
}
```

> **Tip:** While the template is there to help with common configuration settings, IntelliSense is available for the `tasks.json` file as well to help you along.  Use `Ctrl+Space` to see the available settings.

Under the covers we interpret `tsc` as an external task runner exposing exactly one task: the compiling of TypeScript files into JavaScript files. The command we run is: `tsc -p .`

>**Tip:** If you don't have the TypeScript compiler installed, you can [get it here](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Step 3: Run the Build Task

As this is the only task in the file, you can execute it by simply pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` (**Run Build Task**).  At this point you will see an additional file show up in the file list `HelloWorld.js`.

The example TypeScript file did not have any compile problems, so by running the task all that happened was a corresponding `HelloWorld.js` and `HelloWorld.js.map` file was created.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, you can run your simple Hello World example by opening up a terminal and running:

```
node HelloWorld.js
```

> **Tip:** You can also run the program using VS Code's Run/Debug feature. More later.

### Step 4: Reviewing Build Issues

Unfortunately, most builds don't go that smoothly and the result is often some additional information.  For instance, if there was a simple error in our TypeScript file, we may get the following output from `tsc`:

    HelloWorld.ts(3,17): error TS2339: Property 'logg' does not exist on type 'Console'.

This would show up in the output window (which can be opened using `Ctrl+Shift+U`) and selecting Tasks in the output view dropdown.  We parse this output for you and highlight detected problems in the Status Bar.

![Problems in Status Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/typescript_problemstatusbar.png)

You can click on that icon to get a list of the problems and navigate to them.

![Compile Problems](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/typescript_compileerror.png)

You can also use the keyboard to open the list `Ctrl+Shift+M`.

>**Tip:** Tasks offer rich support for many actions. Check the [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) topic for more information on how to configure them.

## Integrated Terminal

VS Code has an integrated terminal which you can use to run shell commands. You can run Node.js directly from there and avoid switching out of VS Code while running command line tools.

**View** > **Integrated Terminal** (``Ctrl+` `` with the backtick character) will open the integrated terminal and you can run `node HelloWorld.ts` there:

![integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/nodejs_integrated-terminal.png)

For this walkthrough, you can use either an external terminal or the VS Code integrated terminal for running the command line tools.

### Debugging Hello World

As mentioned in the introduction, VS Code ships with a debugger for Node.js applications. Let's try debugging our simple Hello World application.

To set a breakpoint in `HelloWorld.ts`, put the editor cursor on the first line and press `F9` or simply click in the editor left gutter next to the line numbers. A red circle will appear in the gutter.

![HelloWorld.ts breakpoint set](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/nodejs_app-js-breakpoint-set.png)

We now need to configure the debugger for this simple workspace.  Select the Debug View in the Side Bar:

![Debug icon](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/nodejs_debugicon.png)

Click on the Configure gear icon at the top of the Debug view to create a default `launch.json` configuration file and select **Node.js** as the Debug Environment. This configuration file lets you specify how to start the application, what arguments to pass in, the working directory, and more.  The new `launch.json` file is created in a VS Code specific `.vscode` folder in root of your workspace.

![hello world launch json](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/nodejs_hello-world-launch-json.png)

> The `program` property will need to be set to `"$workSpaceRoot/app.ts"` for the debugger to pick up the breakpoint in the mapped file. This _should_ just work, but can sometimes be fiddly.

With the default Node.js **Launch Program** configuration created, you can now click Debug tool bar green arrow or press `F5` to launch and debug "Hello World". Your breakpoint will be hit and you can view and step through the simple application.  Notice that VS Code displays an orange Status Bar to indicate it is in Debug mode and the DEBUG CONSOLE is displayed.

![hello world debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/images/nodejs_hello-world-debugging.png)

Now that you've seen VS Code in action with "Hello World", the next section shows using VS Code with a full-stack Node.js web app.

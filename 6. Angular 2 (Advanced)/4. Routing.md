## What do router's do?
Before we jump into the specifics of the Angular Router, let’s talk about what routers do in general.

As you might know, an Angular 2 application is a tree of components. Some of these components are reusable UI components (e.g., list, table), and some are application components. The router cares about application components, or, to be more specific, about their arrangements. Let’s call such component arrangements router states. A router state defines what is visible on the screen.

The router configuration defines all the potential router states an application can be in. Let’s look at an example.

```TypeScript
  [
    {path: 'team/:id', component: TeamCmp, children: [
      {path: 'details', component: DetailsCmp},
      {path: 'help', component: HelpCmp, outlet: 'aux'}
    ]},
    {path: 'summary', component: SummaryCmp},
    {path: 'chat', component: ChatCmp, outlet: 'aux'}
  ]
```

which can be depicted as follows:

An outlet is the location where a component will be placed. If a node has multiple children of the same color, i.e., of the same outlet type, only one of them can be active at a time. Consequently, the team and summary components cannot be displayed together.

A router state is a subtree of the configuration tree. For instance, the example below has the summary component activated.

The router’s primary job is to manage navigations between states, which includes updating the component tree. A navigation is essentially the act of transitioning from one activated subtree to another. Say we perform a navigation, and this is the result:

Because the summary is no longer active, the router will remove it. Instead, it will instantiate the details component and display it inside the team component, with the chat component visible on the side.

That’s it. The router simply allows us to express all the potential states in which our application can be, and provides a mechanism for navigating from one state to another.

So now we’ve learned what routers do in general. It’s time to talk about the Angular router.

The Angular router takes a URL, parses it into a URL tree, recognizes router states, instantiates all the needed components, and, finally, manages navigation. Let’s look at each one of these operations in detail.

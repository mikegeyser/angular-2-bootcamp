_Dependency injection_ is a way to supply a new instance of a class
with the fully-formed dependencies it requires. Most dependencies are services.
Angular uses dependency injection to provide new components with the services they need.

Angular can tell which services a component needs by looking at the types of its constructor parameters.
For example, the constructor of your `HeroListComponent` needs a `HeroService`:

```TypeScript
  constructor(private service: HeroService) { }
```

When Angular creates a component, it first asks an **injector** for
the services that the component requires.

An injector maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created.
If a requested service instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container
before returning the service to Angular.
When all requested services have been resolved and returned,
Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.
This is *dependency injection*.

The process of `HeroService` injection looks a bit like this:

![](https://angular.io/resources/images/devguide/architecture/injector-injects.png)

If the injector doesn't have a `HeroService`, how does it know how to make one?

In brief, you must have previously registered a **provider** of the `HeroService` with the injector.
A provider is something that can create or return a service, typically the service class itself.

You can register providers in modules or in components.

In general, add providers to the root module so that
the same instance of a service is available everywhere.

```TypeScript
  providers: [
    BackendService,
    HeroService,
    Logger
  ],
```

Alternatively, register at a component level in the `providers` property of the `@Component` metadata:

```TypeScript
  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector:    'hero-list',
    templateUrl: 'hero-list.component.html',
    providers:  [ HeroService ]
  })
```

Registering at a component level means you get a new instance of the
service with each new instance of that component.

Points to remember about dependency injection:

* Dependency injection is wired into the Angular framework and used everywhere.

* The *injector* is the main mechanism.
  * An injector maintains a *container* of service instances that it created.
  * An injector can create a new service instance from a *provider*.

* A *provider* is a recipe for creating a service.

* Register *providers* with injectors.

## Why dependency injection?

Let's start with the following code.

```TypeScript
  export class Car {
    public engine: Engine;
    public tires: Tires;
    public description = 'No DI';
    constructor() {
      this.engine = new Engine();
      this.tires = new Tires();
    }
    // Method using the engine and tires
    drive() {
      return `${this.description} car with ` +
        `${this.engine.cylinders} cylinders and ${this.tires.make} tires.`;
    }
  }
```

Our `Car` creates everything it needs inside its constructor.
What's the problem?
The problem is that our `Car` class is brittle, inflexible, and hard to test.

Our `Car` needs an engine and tires. Instead of asking for them,
the `Car` constructor instantiates its own copies from
the very specific classes `Engine` and `Tires`.

What if the `Engine` class evolves and its constructor requires a parameter?
Our `Car` is broken and stays broken until we rewrite it along the lines of
`this.engine = new Engine(theNewParameter)`.
We didn't care about `Engine` constructor parameters when we first wrote `Car`.
We don't really care about them now.
But we'll *have* to start caring because
when the definition of `Engine` changes, our `Car` class must change.
That makes `Car` brittle.

What if we want to put a different brand of tires on our `Car`? Too bad.
We're locked into whatever brand the `Tires` class creates. That makes our `Car` inflexible.

Right now each new car gets its own engine. It can't share an engine with other cars.
While that makes sense for an automobile engine,
we can think of other dependencies that should be shared, such as the onboard
wireless connection to the manufacturer's service center. Our `Car` lacks the flexibility
to share services that have been created previously for other consumers.

When we write tests for our `Car` we're at the mercy of its hidden dependencies.
Is it even possible to create a new `Engine` in a test environment?
What does `Engine`itself depend upon? What does that dependency depend on?
Will a new instance of `Engine` make an asynchronous call to the server?
We certainly don't want that going on during our tests.

What if our `Car` should flash a warning signal when tire pressure is low?
How do we confirm that it actually does flash a warning
if we can't swap in low-pressure tires during the test?

We have no control over the car's hidden dependencies.
When we can't control the dependencies, a class becomes difficult to test.

How can we make `Car` more robust, flexible, and testable?

That's super easy. We change our `Car` constructor to a version with DI:

```TypeScript
  constructor(public engine: Engine, public tires: Tires) {
  }
```

See what happened? We moved the definition of the dependencies to the constructor.
Our `Car` class no longer creates an engine or tires.
It just consumes them.

> We also leveraged TypeScript's constructor syntax for declaring
parameters and properties simultaneously.

Now we create a car by passing the engine and tires to the constructor.

```TypeScript
  // Simple car with 4 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
  let car = new Car(new Engine(), new Tires());
```
  
How cool is that?
The definition of the engine and tire dependencies are
decoupled from the `Car` class itself.
We can pass in any kind of engine or tires we like, as long as they
conform to the general API requirements of an engine or tires.

If someone extends the `Engine` class, that is not `Car`'s problem.

> The _consumer_ of `Car` has the problem. The consumer must update the car creation code to
something like this:

> ```TypeScript
  class Engine2 {
    constructor(public cylinders: number) { }
  }
  // Super car with 12 cylinders and Flintstone tires.
  let bigCylinders = 12;
  let car = new Car(new Engine2(bigCylinders), new Tires());
```
> The critical point is this: `Car` itself did not have to change.
> We'll take care of the consumer's problem soon enough.

The `Car` class is much easier to test because we are in complete control
of its dependencies.
We can pass mocks to the constructor that do exactly what we want them to do
during each test:

```TypeScript
  class MockEngine extends Engine { cylinders = 8; }
  class MockTires  extends Tires  { make = 'YokoGoodStone'; }

  // Test car with 8 cylinders and YokoGoodStone tires.
  let car = new Car(new MockEngine(), new MockTires());
```
  
**We just learned what dependency injection is**.

It's a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external
sources rather than creating them itself.

Cool! But what about that poor consumer?
Anyone who wants a `Car` must now
create all three parts: the `Car`, `Engine`, and `Tires`.
The `Car` class shed its problems at the consumer's expense.
We need something that takes care of assembling these parts for us.

We could write a giant class to do that:

```TypeScript
  import { Engine, Tires, Car } from './car';

  // BAD pattern!
  export class CarFactory {
    createCar() {
      let car = new Car(this.createEngine(), this.createTires());
      car.description = 'Factory';
      return car;
    }
    createEngine() {
      return new Engine();
    }
    createTires() {
      return new Tires();
    }
  }
```

It's not so bad now with only three creation methods.
But maintaining it will be hairy as the application grows.
This factory is going to become a huge spiderweb of
interdependent factory methods!

Wouldn't it be nice if we could simply list the things we want to build without
having to define which dependency gets injected into what?

This is where the dependency injection framework comes into play.
Imagine the framework had something called an _injector_.
We register some classes with this injector, and it figures out how to create them.

When we need a `Car`, we simply ask the injector to get it for us and we're good to go.

```TypeScript
  let car = injector.get(Car);
```

Everyone wins. The `Car` knows nothing about creating an `Engine` or `Tires`.
The consumer knows nothing about creating a `Car`.
We don't have a gigantic factory class to maintain.
Both `Car` and consumer simply ask for what they need and the injector delivers.

This is what a **dependency injection framework** is all about.

_Dependency injection_ is a way to supply a new instance of a class
with the fully-formed dependencies it requires. Most dependencies are services.
Angular uses dependency injection to provide new components with the services they need.

Angular can tell which services a component needs by looking at the types of its constructor parameters.
For example, the constructor of your `HeroListComponent` needs a `HeroService`:

```TypeScript
  constructor(private service: HeroService) { }
```

When Angular creates a component, it first asks an **injector** for
the services that the component requires.

An injector maintains a container of service instances that it has previously created.
If a requested service instance is not in the container, the injector makes one and adds it to the container
before returning the service to Angular.
When all requested services have been resolved and returned,
Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.
This is *dependency injection*.

The process of `HeroService` injection looks a bit like this:

If the injector doesn't have a `HeroService`, how does it know how to make one?

In brief, you must have previously registered a **provider** of the `HeroService` with the injector.
A provider is something that can create or return a service, typically the service class itself.

You can register providers in modules or in components.

In general, add providers to the root module so that
the same instance of a service is available everywhere.

```TypeScript
  providers: [
    BackendService,
    HeroService,
    Logger
  ],
```

Alternatively, register at a component level in the `providers` property of the `@Component` metadata:

```TypeScript
  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector:    'hero-list',
    templateUrl: 'hero-list.component.html',
    providers:  [ HeroService ]
  })
```

Registering at a component level means you get a new instance of the
service with each new instance of that component.

Points to remember about dependency injection:

* Dependency injection is wired into the Angular framework and used everywhere.

* The *injector* is the main mechanism.
  * An injector maintains a *container* of service instances that it created.
  * An injector can create a new service instance from a *provider*.

* A *provider* is a recipe for creating a service.

* Register *providers* with injectors.

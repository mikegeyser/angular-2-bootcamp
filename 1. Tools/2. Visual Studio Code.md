# Running VS Code on Windows

## Installation

1. Download the [Visual Studio Code installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107) for Windows.
2. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeSetup-stable.exe). This will only take a minute.
3. By default, VS Code is installed under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft VS Code` for a 64-bit machine.

You can also find a Zip archive [here](/docs/?dv=winzip).

>**Note:** .NET Framework 4.5.2 is required for VS Code.  If you are using Windows 7, please make sure [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42643) is installed.

>**Tip:** Setup will optionally add Visual Studio Code to your `%PATH%`, so from the console you can simply type `code .` to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the `%PATH%` environmental variable to take effect.

# The Basics of Visual Studio Code

At its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.

## Files, Folders & Projects

VS Code is file and folder based - you can get started immediately by opening a file or folder in VS Code.

On top of this, VS Code can read and take advantage of a variety of project files defined by different frameworks and platforms. For example, if the folder you opened in VS Code contains one or more `package.json`, `project.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or .NET Core Visual Studio solution and project files, VS Code will read these files and use them to provide additional functionality, such as rich IntelliSense in the editor.

## Basic Layout

VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The UI is divided into five areas:

* **Editor** The main area to edit your files. You can open up to three editors side by side.
* **Side Bar** Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
* **Status Bar** Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
* **View Bar** Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.
* **Panels** You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated terminal.

Each time you start VS Code, it opens up in the same state it was in when you last closed it. The folder, layout, and opened files are preserved.

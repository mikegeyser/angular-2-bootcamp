_[Adapted from Angular 2 Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)_

Our stakeholders appreciate our progress.
Now they want to get the hero data from a server, let users add, edit, and delete heroes,
and save these changes back to the server.

In this chapter we teach our application to make the corresponding HTTP calls to a remote server's web API.

## Where We Left Off

In the previous chapter, we learned to navigate between the dashboard and the fixed heroes list, editing a selected hero along the way.
That's our starting point for this chapter.

### Keep the app transpiling and running

Open a terminal/console window and enter the following command to
start the TypeScript compiler, start the server, and watch for changes:

```shell
  npm start
```

The application runs and updates automatically as we continue to build the Tour of Heroes.

# Providing HTTP Services
The `HttpModule` is ***not*** a core Angular module.
It's Angular's optional approach to web access and it exists as a separate add-on module called `@angular/http`,
shipped in a separate script file as part of the Angular npm package.

Fortunately we're ready to import from `@angular/http` because `systemjs.config` configured *SystemJS* to load that library when we need it.

### Register for HTTP services

Our app will depend upon the Angular `http` service which itself depends upon other supporting services.
The `HttpModule` from `@angular/http` library holds providers for a complete set of HTTP services.

We should be able to access these services from anywhere in the application.
So we register them all by adding `HttpModule` to the `imports` list of the `AppModule` where we
bootstrap the application and its root `AppComponent`.


```TypeScript
  import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
  import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
  import { FormsModule }   from '@angular/forms';
  import { HttpModule }    from '@angular/http';
  import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
  import { AppComponent }         from './app.component';
  import { DashboardComponent }   from './dashboard.component';
  import { HeroesComponent }      from './heroes.component';
  import { HeroDetailComponent }  from './hero-detail.component';
  import { HeroService }          from './hero.service';

  @NgModule({
    imports: [
      BrowserModule,
      FormsModule,
      HttpModule,
      AppRoutingModule
    ],
    declarations: [
      AppComponent,
      DashboardComponent,
      HeroDetailComponent,
      HeroesComponent,
    ],
    providers: [ HeroService ],
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
  })
  export class AppModule { }
```

Notice that we supply `HttpModule` as part of the *imports* array in root NgModule `AppModule`.

## Simulating the web API

We recommend registering application-wide services in the root
`AppModule` *providers*.

Our application is in the early stages of development and far from ready for production.
We don't even have a web server that can handle requests for heroes.
Until we do, *we'll have to fake it*.

We're going to *trick* the HTTP client into fetching and saving data from
a mock service, the *in-memory web API*.

Here is a version of `appModule` that performs this trick:

```TypeScript
  import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
  import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
  import { FormsModule }   from '@angular/forms';
  import { HttpModule }    from '@angular/http';

  import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';

  // Imports for loading & configuring the in-memory web api
  import { InMemoryWebApiModule } from 'angular-in-memory-web-api';
  import { InMemoryDataService }  from './in-memory-data.service';

  import { AppComponent }         from './app.component';
  import { DashboardComponent }   from './dashboard.component';
  import { HeroesComponent }      from './heroes.component';
  import { HeroDetailComponent }  from './hero-detail.component';
  import { HeroService }          from './hero.service';

  @NgModule({
    imports: [
      BrowserModule,
      FormsModule,
      HttpModule,
      InMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(InMemoryDataService),
      AppRoutingModule
    ],
    declarations: [
      AppComponent,
      DashboardComponent,
      HeroDetailComponent,
      HeroesComponent,
    ],
    providers: [ HeroService ],
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
  })
  export class AppModule { }
```

Rather than require a real API server, this example simulates communication with the remote server by adding the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api" target="_blank" title="In-memory Web API"><i>InMemoryWebApiModule</i></a>
to the module `imports`, effectively  replacing the `Http` client's XHR backend service with an in-memory alternative.

```TypeScript
  InMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(InMemoryDataService),
```

The `forRoot` configuration method takes an `InMemoryDataService` class
that primes the in-memory database as follows:

```TypeScript
  import { InMemoryDbService } from 'angular-in-memory-web-api';

  export class InMemoryDataService implements InMemoryDbService {
    createDb() {
      let heroes = [
        {id: 11, name: 'Mr. Nice'},
        {id: 12, name: 'Narco'},
        {id: 13, name: 'Bombasto'},
        {id: 14, name: 'Celeritas'},
        {id: 15, name: 'Magneta'},
        {id: 16, name: 'RubberMan'},
        {id: 17, name: 'Dynama'},
        {id: 18, name: 'Dr IQ'},
        {id: 19, name: 'Magma'},
        {id: 20, name: 'Tornado'}
      ];
      return {heroes};
    }
  }
```

This file replaces the `mock-heroes.ts` which is now safe to delete.

> This chapter is an introduction to the Angular_http_library.
Please don't be distracted by the details of this backend substitution. Just follow along with the example.

## Heroes and HTTP

Look at our current `HeroService` implementation

```TypeScript
  getHeroes(): Promise<Hero[]> {
    return Promise.resolve(HEROES);
  }
```

We returned a Promise resolved with mock heroes.
It may have seemed like overkill at the time, but we were anticipating the
day when we fetched heroes with an HTTP client and we knew that would have to be an asynchronous operation.

That day has arrived! Let's convert `getHeroes()` to use HTTP.

```TypeScript
  private heroesUrl = 'api/heroes';  // URL to web api

  constructor(private http: Http) { }

  getHeroes(): Promise<Hero[]> {
    return this.http.get(this.heroesUrl)
               .toPromise()
               .then(response => response.json().data as Hero[])
               .catch(this.handleError);
  }

  private handleError(error: any): Promise<any> {
    console.error('An error occurred', error); // for demo purposes only
    return Promise.reject(error.message || error);
  }
```

Our updated import statements are now:

```TypeScript
  import { Injectable }    from '@angular/core';
  import { Headers, Http } from '@angular/http';

  import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';

  import { Hero } from './hero';
```

Refresh the browser, and the hero data should be successfully loaded from the
mock server.

###HTTP Promise

We're still returning a Promise but we're creating it differently.

The Angular `http.get` returns an RxJS `Observable`.
*Observables* are a powerful way to manage asynchronous data flows.
We'll learn about observables later in this chapter.

For *now* we get back on familiar ground by immediately
converting that `Observable` to a `Promise` using the `toPromise` operator.

```
  .toPromise()
```

Unfortunately, the Angular `Observable` doesn't have a `toPromise` operator ...
not out of the box.
The Angular `Observable` is a bare-bones implementation.

There are scores of operators like `toPromise` that extend `Observable` with useful capabilities.
If we want those capabilities, we have to add the operators ourselves.
That's as easy as importing them from the RxJS library like this:

```TypeScript
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';
```

You'll add more operators, and learn why you must do so, later in this tutorial.

### Extracting the data in the *then* callback

In the *promise*'s `then` callback we call the `json` method of the HTTP `Response` to extract the
data within the response.

```TypeScript
  .then(response => response.json().data as Hero[])
```

That response JSON has a single `data` property.
The `data` property holds the array of *heroes* that the caller really wants.
So we grab that array and return it as the resolved Promise value.

> Pay close attention to the shape of the data returned by the server.
This particular *in-memory web API* example happens to return an object with a `data` property.
Your API might return something else. Adjust the code to match *your web API*.

The caller is unaware of these machinations. It receives a Promise of *heroes* just as it did before.
It has no idea that we fetched the heroes from the (mock) server.
It knows nothing of the twists and turns required to convert the HTTP response into heroes.
Such is the beauty and purpose of delegating data access to a service like this `HeroService`.

### Error Handling

At the end of `getHeroes()` we `catch` server failures and pass them to an error handler:

```
  .catch(this.handleError);
```

This is a critical step!
We must anticipate HTTP failures as they happen frequently for reasons beyond our control.

```TypeScript
  private handleError(error: any): Promise<any> {
    console.error('An error occurred', error); // for demo purposes only
    return Promise.reject(error.message || error);
  }
```

In this demo service we log the error to the console; we would do better in real life.

We've also decided to return a user friendly form of the error to
the caller in a rejected promise so that the caller can display a proper error message to the user.

### Get hero by id
The `HeroDetailComponent` asks the `HeroService` to fetch a single hero to edit.

The `HeroService` currently fetches all heroes and then finds the desired hero
by filtering for the one with the matching `id`.
That's fine in a simulation. It's wasteful to ask a real server for _all_ heroes when we only want one.
Most web APIs support a _get-by-id_ request in the form `api/hero/:id` (e.g., `api/hero/11`).

Update the `HeroService.getHero` method to make a _get-by-id_ request,
applying what we just learned to write `getHeroes`:

```TypeScript
  getHero(id: number): Promise<Hero> {
    const url = `${this.heroesUrl}/${id}`;
    return this.http.get(url)
      .toPromise()
      .then(response => response.json().data as Hero)
      .catch(this.handleError);
  }
```

It's almost the same as `getHeroes`.
The URL identifies _which_ hero the server should update by encoding the hero id into the URL
to match the `api/hero/:id` pattern.

We also adjust to the fact that the `data` in the response is a single hero object rather than an array.

### Unchanged _getHeroes_ API

Although we made significant *internal* changes to `getHeroes()` and `getHero()`,
the public signatures did not change.
We still return a Promise from both methods.
We won't have to update any of the components that call them.

Our stakeholders are thrilled with the web API integration so far.
Now they want the ability to create and delete heroes.

Let's see first what happens when we try to update a hero's details.

## Update hero details

We can edit a hero's name already in the hero detail view. Go ahead and try
it. As we type, the hero name is updated in the view heading.
But when we hit the `Back` button, the changes are lost!

Updates weren't lost before. What changed?
When the app used a list of mock heroes, updates were applied directly to the
hero objects within the single, app-wide, shared list. Now that we are fetching data
from a server, if we want changes to persist, we'll need to write them back to
the server.

### Save hero details

Let's ensure that edits to a hero's name aren't lost. Start by adding,
to the end of the hero detail template, a save button with a `click` event
binding that invokes a new component method named `save`:

```html
  <button (click)="save()">Save</button>
```

The `save` method persists hero name changes using the hero service
`update` method and then navigates back to the previous view:

```TypeScript
  save(): void {
    this.heroService.update(this.hero)
      .then(() => this.goBack());
  }
```

### Hero service `update` method

The overall structure of the `update` method is similar to that of
`getHeroes`, although we'll use an HTTP _put_ to persist changes
server-side:

```TypeScript
  private headers = new Headers({'Content-Type': 'application/json'});

  update(hero: Hero): Promise<Hero> {
    const url = `${this.heroesUrl}/${hero.id}`;
    return this.http
      .put(url, JSON.stringify(hero), {headers: this.headers})
      .toPromise()
      .then(() => hero)
      .catch(this.handleError);
  }
```

We identify _which_ hero the server should update by encoding the hero id in
the URL. The put body is the JSON string encoding of the hero, obtained by
calling `JSON_stringify`.  We identify the body content type
(`application/json`) in the request header.

Refresh the browser and give it a try. Changes to hero names should now persist.

## Add a hero

To add a new hero we need to know the hero's name. Let's use an input
element for that, paired with an add button.

Insert the following into the heroes component HTML, first thing after
the heading:

```html
  <div>
    <label>Hero name:</label> <input #heroName />
    <button (click)="add(heroName.value); heroName.value=''">
      Add
    </button>
  </div>
```

In response to a click event, we call the component's click handler and then
clear the input field so that it will be ready to use for another name.

```TypeScript
  add(name: string): void {
    name = name.trim();
    if (!name) { return; }
    this.heroService.create(name)
      .then(hero => {
        this.heroes.push(hero);
        this.selectedHero = null;
      });
  }
```

When the given name is non-blank, the handler delegates creation of the
named hero to the hero service, and then adds the new hero to our array.

Finally, we implement the `create` method in the `HeroService` class.

```TypeScript
  create(name: string): Promise<Hero> {
    return this.http
      .post(this.heroesUrl, JSON.stringify({name: name}), {headers: this.headers})
      .toPromise()
      .then(res => res.json().data)
      .catch(this.handleError);
  }
```

Refresh the browser and create some new heroes!

## Delete a hero

Too many heroes?
Let's add a delete button to each hero in the heroes view.

Add this button element to the heroes component HTML, right after the hero
name in the repeated `<li>` tag:

```html
  <button class="delete"
    (click)="delete(hero); $event.stopPropagation()">x</button>
```

The `<li>` element should now look like this:

```html
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="onSelect(hero)"
      [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero">
    <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span>
    <span>{{hero.name}}</span>
    <button class="delete"
      (click)="delete(hero); $event.stopPropagation()">x</button>
  </li>
```

In addition to calling the component's `delete` method, the delete button
click handling code stops the propagation of the click event &mdash; we
don't want the `<li>` click handler to be triggered because that would
select the hero that we are going to delete!

The logic of the `delete` handler is a bit trickier:

```TypeScript
  delete(hero: Hero): void {
    this.heroService
        .delete(hero.id)
        .then(() => {
          this.heroes = this.heroes.filter(h => h !== hero);
          if (this.selectedHero === hero) { this.selectedHero = null; }
        });
  }
```

Of course, we delegate hero deletion to the hero service, but the component
is still responsible for updating the display: it removes the deleted hero
from the array and resets the selected hero if necessary.

We want our delete button to be placed at the far right of the hero entry.
This extra CSS accomplishes that:

```css
  button.delete {
    float:right;
    margin-top: 2px;
    margin-right: .8em;
    background-color: gray !important;
    color:white;
  }
```

### Hero service `delete` method

The hero service's `delete` method uses the _delete_ HTTP method to remove the hero from the server:

```TypeScript
  delete(id: number): Promise<void> {
    const url = `${this.heroesUrl}/${id}`;
    return this.http.delete(url, {headers: this.headers})
      .toPromise()
      .then(() => null)
      .catch(this.handleError);
  }
```

Refresh the browser and try the new delete functionality.

## Observables

Each `Http` service method  returns an `Observable` of HTTP `Response` objects.

Our `HeroService` converts that `Observable` into a `Promise` and returns the promise to the caller.
In this section we learn to return the `Observable` directly and discuss when and why that might be
a good thing to do.

### Background
An *observable* is a stream of events that we can process with array-like operators.

Angular core has basic support for observables.
We developers augment that support with operators and extensions from the
<a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs" target="_blank" title="RxJS">RxJS library</a>.
We'll see how shortly.

Recall that our `HeroService` quickly chained the `toPromise` operator to the `Observable` result of `http.get`.
That operator converted the `Observable` into a `Promise` and we passed that promise back to the caller.

Converting to a promise is often a good choice. We typically ask `http.get` to fetch a single chunk of data.
When we receive the data, we're done.
A single result in the form of a promise is easy for the calling component to consume
and it helps that promises are widely understood by JavaScript programmers.

But requests aren't always "one and done". We may start one request,
then cancel it, and make a different request before the server has responded to the first request.
Such a _request-cancel-new-request_ sequence is difficult to implement with *Promises*.
It's easy with *Observables* as we'll see.

### Search-by-name
We're going to add a *hero search* feature to the Tour of Heroes.
As the user types a name into a search box, we'll make repeated HTTP requests for heroes filtered by that name.

We start by creating `HeroSearchService` that sends search queries to our server's web api.

```TypeScript
  import { Injectable }     from '@angular/core';
  import { Http, Response } from '@angular/http';
  import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
  import { Hero }           from './hero';

  @Injectable()
  export class HeroSearchService {
    constructor(private http: Http) {}
    search(term: string): Observable<Hero[]> {
      return this.http
                 .get(`app/heroes/?name=${term}`)
                 .map((r: Response) => r.json().data as Hero[]);
    }
  }
```

The `privhttp.get()` call in `HeroSearchService` is similar to the one
in the `HeroService`, although the URL now has a query string.

<span if-docs="ts">A more important difference: we no longer call `toPromise`.
Instead we return the *observable* from the the `htttp.get`,
after chaining it to another RxJS operator, <code>map</code>,
to extract heroes from the response data.

RxJS operator chaining makes response processing easy and readable.
See the [discuss below about operators](#rxjs-imports).
</span>

### HeroSearchComponent

Let's create a new `HeroSearchComponent` that calls this new `HeroSearchService`.

The component template is simple &mdash; just a text box and a list of matching search results.

```html
<!-- app/hero-search.component.html -->
  <div id="search-component">
    <h4>Hero Search</h4>
    <input #searchBox id="search-box" (keyup)="search(searchBox.value)" />
    <div>
      <div *ngFor="let hero of heroes | async"
           (click)="gotoDetail(hero)" class="search-result" >
        {{hero.name}}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

We'll also want to add styles for the new component.

```css
/*app/hero-search.component.css*/
  .search-result{
    border-bottom: 1px solid gray;
    border-left: 1px solid gray;
    border-right: 1px solid gray;
    width:195px;
    height: 20px;
    padding: 5px;
    background-color: white;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  #search-box{
    width: 200px;
    height: 20px;
  }
```

As the user types in the search box, a *keyup* event binding calls the component's `search` method with the new search box value.

The `*ngFor` repeats *hero* objects from the component's `heroes` property. No surprise there.

But, as we'll soon see, the `heroes` property is now an *Observable* of hero arrays, rather than just a hero array.
The `*ngFor` can't do anything with an `Observable` until we flow it through the `async` pipe (`AsyncPipe`).
The `async` pipe subscribes to the `Observable` and produces the array of heroes to `*ngFor`.

Time to create the `HeroSearchComponent` class and metadata.

```TypeScript
// app/hero-search.component.ts

  import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
  import { Router }            from '@angular/router';
  import { Observable }        from 'rxjs/Observable';
  import { Subject }           from 'rxjs/Subject';
  import { HeroSearchService } from './hero-search.service';
  import { Hero } from './hero';

  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: 'hero-search',
    templateUrl: 'hero-search.component.html',
    styleUrls: [ 'hero-search.component.css' ],
    providers: [HeroSearchService]
  })
  export class HeroSearchComponent implements OnInit {
    heroes: Observable<Hero[]>;
    private searchTerms = new Subject<string>();
    constructor(
      private heroSearchService: HeroSearchService,
      private router: Router) {}
    // Push a search term into the observable stream.
    search(term: string): void {
      this.searchTerms.next(term);
    }
    ngOnInit(): void {
      this.heroes = this.searchTerms
        .debounceTime(300)        // wait for 300ms pause in events
        .distinctUntilChanged()   // ignore if next search term is same as previous
        .switchMap(term => term   // switch to new observable each time
          // return the http search observable
          ? this.heroSearchService.search(term)
          // or the observable of empty heroes if no search term
          : Observable.of<Hero[]>([]))
        .catch(error => {
          // TODO: real error handling
          console.log(error);
          return Observable.of<Hero[]>([]);
        });
    }
    gotoDetail(hero: Hero): void {
      let link = ['/detail', hero.id];
      this.router.navigate(link);
    }
  }
```

#### Search terms

Let's focus on the `searchTerms`:

```TypeScript
  private searchTerms = new Subject<string>();

  // Push a search term into the observable stream.
  search(term: string): void {
    this.searchTerms.next(term);
  }
```

A `Subject` is a producer of an _observable_ event stream;
`searchTerms` produces an `Observable` of strings, the filter criteria for the name search.

Each call to `search` puts a new string into this subject's _observable_ stream by calling `next`.

#### Initialize the _**heroes**_ property (_**ngOnInit**_)

A `Subject` is also an `Observable`.
We're going to turn the stream
of search terms into a stream of `Hero` arrays and assign the result to the `heroes` property.

```TypeScript
  heroes: Observable<Hero[]>;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.heroes = this.searchTerms
      .debounceTime(300)        // wait for 300ms pause in events
      .distinctUntilChanged()   // ignore if next search term is same as previous
      .switchMap(term => term   // switch to new observable each time
        // return the http search observable
        ? this.heroSearchService.search(term)
        // or the observable of empty heroes if no search term
        : Observable.of<Hero[]>([]))
      .catch(error => {
        // TODO: real error handling
        console.log(error);
        return Observable.of<Hero[]>([]);
      });
  }
```

If we passed every user keystroke directly to the `HeroSearchService`, we'd unleash a storm of HTTP requests.
Bad idea. We don't want to tax our server resources and burn through our cellular network data plan.

Fortunately, we can chain `Observable` operators to the string `Observable` that reduce the request flow.
We'll make fewer calls to the `HeroSearchService` and still get timely results. Here's how:

* `debounceTime(300)` waits until the flow of new string events pauses for 300 milliseconds
before passing along the latest string. We'll never make requests more frequently than 300ms.

* `distinctUntilChanged` ensures that we only send a request if the filter text changed.
There's no point in repeating a request for the same search term.

* `switchMap` calls our search service for each search term that makes it through the `debounce` and `distinctUntilChanged` gauntlet.
It cancels and discards previous search observables, returning only the latest search service observable.

> The [switchMap operator](http://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/transformation/switchmap.html)
(formerly known as "flatMapLatest") is very clever.

> Every qualifying key event can trigger an `http` method call.
Even with a 300ms pause between requests, we could have multiple HTTP requests in flight
and they may not return in the order sent.

> `switchMap` preserves the original request order while returning
only the observable from the most recent `http` method call.
Results from prior calls are canceled and discarded.

> We also short-circuit the `http` method call and return an observable containing an empty array
if the search text is empty.

> Note that _canceling_ the `HeroSearchService` observable won't actually abort a pending HTTP request
until the service supports that feature, a topic for another day.
We are content for now to discard unwanted results.

* `catch` intercepts a failed observable.
Our simple example prints the error to the console; a real life application should do better.
Then we return an observable containing an empty array to clear the search result.

### Import RxJS operators

The RxJS operators are not available in Angular's base `Observable` implementation. We have to extend `Observable` by importing them.
We could extend Observable with just the operators we need here by including the pertinent import statements at the top of this file.
We take a different approach in this example. We combine all of the RxJS `Observable` extensions that our entire app requires into a single RxJS imports file.

```TypeScript
// app rxjs-extensions.ts
  // Observable class extensions
  import 'rxjs/add/observable/of';
  import 'rxjs/add/observable/throw';

  // Observable operators
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/catch';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/debounceTime';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/distinctUntilChanged';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/do';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/filter';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/switchMap';
```

We load them all at once by importing `rxjs-extensions` at the top of `AppModule`.

```TypeScript
// app/app.module.ts
  import './rxjs-extensions';
```

### Add the search component to the dashboard

We add the hero search HTML element to the bottom of the `DashboardComponent` template.

```html
<!-- app/dashboard.component.html -->
  <h3>Top Heroes</h3>
  <div class="grid grid-pad">
    <a *ngFor="let hero of heroes"  [routerLink]="['/detail', hero.id]"  class="col-1-4">
      <div class="module hero">
        <h4>{{hero.name}}</h4>
      </div>
    </a>
  </div>
  <hero-search></hero-search>
```

Finally, we import `HeroSearchComponent` from `hero-search.component.ts`
and add it to the `declarations` array:

```TypeScript
// app/app.module.ts

  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    DashboardComponent,
    HeroDetailComponent,
    HeroesComponent,
    HeroSearchComponent
  ],
```

Run the app again, go to the *Dashboard*, and enter some text in the search box.
At some point it might look like this.

## Home Stretch

We are at the end of our journey for now, but we have accomplished a lot.
- We added the necessary dependencies to use HTTP in our application.
- We refactored `HeroService` to load heroes from a web API.
- We extended `HeroService` to support post, put and delete methods.
- We updated our components to allow adding, editing and deleting of heroes.
- We configured an in-memory web API.
- We learned how to use Observables.
